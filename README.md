=== Welcome to SMV ===

The aim of this theme is to make seperate out the login and view permissions
from each other in the back end. By using templates, the SMV theme can re-route
to different pages dependant on the user - which makes for a great user, administrator
and editor experience.

The theme is based on _s with a custom gulpfile that you will need to edit to get up and
running with Browsersync.
